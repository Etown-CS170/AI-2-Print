# AI-2 -Print Setup Information 
## Written By: Phillip Goldberg

These instructions have been tested to run on Google Colab with their provided resources. These
steps should work on your own machine but for best support use Google Colab.

**!** and **%** symbols are only needed to run commands in Colab. When changing directories on your
own machine the root directory will not be **“/content”** so make sure your paths are correct.

The repository has the python files and or the Jupyter Notebook file, so you do not have to running
through every step but if you want to try it yourself, I highly recommend it.

### **1.** Get needed files
- First you need to clone Shap-e from OpenAI’s repository:
[https://github.com/openai/shap-e](https://github.com/openai/shap-e)
[https://github.com/Nehri/slicing_algorithm.git](https://github.com/Nehri/slicing_algorithm.git)
```
!git clone https://github.com/openai/shap-e.git
```
- Then you need to clone the Slicing Algorithm from their repository:
```
!git clone https://github.com/Nehri/slicing_algorithm.git
```
### **2.** Then you need to install Shap-e:
```
%cd /content/shap-e/
!pip install -e.
```
### **3.** Then you need to install required python packages using pip:
```
!pip install pymeshlab
!pip install numpy
!pip install torch
!pip install numpy-stl
!pip install stlconverter
!pip install colorama
```
### **4.** Now you need to import the libraries required:
```
import torch
import pymeshlab
from shap_e.diffusion.sample import sample_latents
from shap_e.diffusion.gaussian_diffusion import diffusion_from_config
from shap_e.models.download import load_model, load_config
from shap_e.util.notebooks import decode_latent_mesh
from shap_e.util.notebooks import create_pan_cameras, decode_latent_images, gif_widget
```
### **5.** Set torch to use your GPU instead of CPU for faster processing:
```
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
```
### **6.** Set the Stable Diffusion Models:
```
xm = load_model('transmitter', device=device)
model = load_model('text300M', device=device)
diffusion = diffusion_from_config(load_config('diffusion'))
```
### **7.** Setup Shap-e/Stable Diffusion Setting and User Prompt:
```
batch_size = 1
guidance_scale = 15,
prompt = "baby grand piano"  # area for user to type text prompt for mesh generation

latents = sample_latents(
    batch_size=batch_size,
    model=model,
    diffusion=diffusion,
    guidance_scale=guidance_scale,
    model_kwargs=dict(texts=[prompt] * batch_size),
    progress=True,
    clip_denoised=True,
    use_fp16=True,
    use_karras=True,
    karras_steps=20, # this sets the amount of noise in processing the mesh
    sigma_min=1e-3,
    sigma_max=160,
    s_churn=0,
)
```
### **8.** Write the Generated Mesh to OBJ File:
```
for i, latent in enumerate(latents):
    t = decode_latent_mesh(xm, latent).tri_mesh()
    with open(f'mesh_{i}.obj', 'w') as f:
        t.write_obj(f)
```
### **9.** Convert OBJ file to STL:
```
ms = pymeshlab.MeshSet()

# Load the OBJ file
ms.load_new_mesh('/content/shap-e/mesh_0.obj')

# Save as STL
ms.save_current_mesh('mesh.stl')
```
### **10.** Convert Binary STL File to ASCII Formated STL:
- This is required because the slicing script cannot use binary formatting
```
!python3 -m stlconverter /content/shap-e/mesh.stl stla
```
### **11.** Slice the STL File into gcode for 3D printing:
- Slicing STL Mesh with User Provided Parameters: 0.25 is layer height and 0 is infill
       percentage.
       It is important to mention that your printer configuration may be different from the
       defaults in the slicing.py file. Bed size and a few other settings can be easily
       changed in that file.
```
!python3 /content/slicing_algorithm/slicing.py /content/shap-e/mesh-converted-ASCII.stl 0.25 0
```
- It is important to note that slicing 3D models generated by Shap-e will take a very long to to slice,
even when running in Google Colab. This could be hours long. I highly recommend using software
like [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/), [Simplfiy3D](https://www.simplify3d.com/), or [Slic3r](https://slic3r.org/) to slice your generated models as it will be very fast. That way your
models slice in seconds. The use of Slicing Algorithm is good at simple meshes and using it for high
triangle counts is experimental. Models generated can have holes and defects that can make parts unprintable. To fixed these issues you can use tools like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and [Meshmixer](https://apps.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Detail/Index?id=4108920185261935100&appLang=en&os=Win64) to repair meshes.
